Hindi Fake News Detector is a suite of tools to fight disinformation on the web. These inform the user of a news report's reliability, media bias and objectivity using sophisticated Machine Learning Models.The extension summarises the report for the user's convenience, and suggests similar verified artciles.
To combat the spread of Hindi misinformation, we have made a Hindi Fake News Detector using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Being native Hindi speakers, we understood this problem well and used a dataset we scraped and annotated on our own. Our one-of-a-kind detector provides accuracy up to 82.32 percent!

## Follow the below instructions to run the solution:

-Run the Web-Scraping code providing a URL as input. You'll get scraped links.
-Run the ML and DL code cell by cell to get the accuracy with different models. 
-For the deployment of our website, we suggest Heroku. Just need to connect the local git repository to the Heroku app. To do this we add the remote of the Heroku app to the git repository and push the changes to our Heroku app and our website will be live on Heroku.
